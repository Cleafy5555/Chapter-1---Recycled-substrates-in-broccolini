# Chapter-1---Recycled-substrates-in-broccolini
The code supports a multi-experiment study evaluating (i) productivity and yield dynamics of broccolini grown in alternative substrates, (ii) nutrient composition of plant tissues across substrates, and (iii) the effects of substrate selection on broccolini performance under Plasmodiophora brassicae infection.
